# Introduction to functional programming in F# - I mean Kotlin

Hello my friend,

when I went out to find a new job - I met Trustbit and I learned that F# exists.
If you don't know F# then welcome to the team ;)
In a nutshell it is a functional programming language in the Microsoft universe.

I already looked into functional programming in the past,
and it is a topic that was discussed many times in my old company.
But besides a project in Scala here and there we never committed to the idea completely as we still live in a Java world.

And now comes Kotlin.
Which seems to be a hybrid, somehow.

Long story short - as I am learning Kotlin I was wondering if I could translate the F# series into Kotlin.
NOT to proof that X is better than Y.
Just to see what are similarities, what are differences, just to satisfy my curiosity.

At the end of the day we are all developers,
and we serve the same lord named "production".

If you are curious about the series then here is the link for you:
